The PYG- 24 Time Tracker is a time tracking program that allows users to track money paid based on the number of hours and minutes the user works. 
The program can be used by business consultants, project professionals, and anyone whose pay (salary/ wage) is based on the number of hours and minutes worked. 
This program was developed using the agile approach and coded with the python programming language.

How the program works:
1. When a user launches the program, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is loaded and prompt user to enter his username and hourly pay rate.
2. User can clock in for system to capture the time he started working on the task.
3. After task is completed, user can check clock out for system to register when task was completed.
4. The amount of time spent on the task is calculated and then the amount earned is calculated and displayed.
5. User can proceed to save the work by clicking save and details would be stored in a csv file with name and location based on users preference


The link below contains the architecture (conceptual view) of  the program:

Algorithm is based on the following steps:
Pseudocode:
1. User launches the program
2. User enters username and hourly pay rate.
3. User clocks in and the System's current time (Clock in time) is displayed. 
4. User clocks out and the System's current time (Clock out time) is displayed.
5. The program calculate and displays the number of hours and minutes using the 'clock in' time and 'clock out' time.
6. The program calculates and diplays the total amount of pay using the hourly rate and the number of hours and minutes.
5. User saves the information and the program saves it to a csv/excel file.
