This is a time based program in which user salary earned for
a particular tasked is obtained based on the amount of time
spent on a particular task.

Algorith is based on the following steps 
Processes involved
1. GUI should introduce itself
2. System accept user clock in time
3. System accept user clock out time
4. system mke calculations based on time
5. System saves to either csv/excel file

How the program works
When user launches the program, the  GUI interface appears
and prompt user to enter his personal details.
User can then clock in for system to capture the time he
started working on the task.
After task is completed, user can check clock out for system
to register when task was completed.
The amount of time spent can be calculated and then the amount
earned can be calculated
User can proceed to save the work by clicking save and
details would be stored in a csv file with name and 
location based on users preference
